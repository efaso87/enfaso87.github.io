                <div class="project-details">
                <p>This is a social media website application/social media platform I created called "Food4Thought". This is by far one of my proudest projects I've worked on- I absolutely love everything about it, especially the beautiful UI/UX (in my humble opinion). As can be read in the slogan- it was created by foodies (myself), for foodies. It embodies everything a foodie could ever want in a social platform, a stress-free, calming environment that allows you to explore new recipes, see your friends' declious dishes, and more! It even has a feature that suggests nearby "foodie" events a user might like! It's still a work in progress, but I am extremely passionate about this project and can't wait to see its' progression.</p>

            <p>This is an e-commerce mock site (with limited web design at the moment- don't mind that) focusing on primarily advanced JavaScript features and advanced JavaScript skills/concepts. It includes an item maintenance system where adminsitrators can manage and update product details being displayed on the e-commerce side, as well as add new products and delete ones they don't want visisble anymore. Users on the e-commerce side however are able to easily browse, filter, and sort products for purchase. They can then drag-and-drop, add them to their cart, check-out, and see real-time updates.</p>

              with players aiming to catch hearts to reach new levels and break high scores. It gets progressively harder as
              players advance, and the game ends when they miss five hearts.</p>

                Hi! My name is Emily as you may already know, and I am currently about to conclude my senior year at Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania as a Computer Science major with a focus in Web Development this upcoming May of 2025. I pride myself in my skills and passion for website development, website design, and creating aesthetically pleasing UI/UX for mobile and desktop applications, but I am interested in all fields of tech- including, but not limited to: front-end development, back-end development, full-stack development, data analysis, IT hardware & security, and pretty much anything else you can think of- if it involves technology, I'm into it.
              </div>
              <div class="col align-self-center">
                As for my skillsets, I have extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, a variety of different frameworks and
                API, Java, Python, SQL, C, C++, technological digital design, etcetera. I am also
                knowledgeable about creating wireframes, user flows, process flows and site maps. I am
                up-to-date with all the latest web trends, techniques, and technologies. I also have experience
                with graphic design and of course as I mentioned prior, beautiful and interactive UX and UI
                designs. My ultimate dream is to one day be able to incorporate my love for programming with my love for the fashion and beauty industry, or the gaming industry!
